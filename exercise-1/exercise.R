# How many books are in the dataset?


# Which book has the most lines?


# Use the unnest_tokens function to generate the full list of words


# Which words are most common (regardless of which book them come from)?


# Remove stop words by performing an anti_join with the stop_words dataframe


# Which non stop-words are most common?


# Use ggplot to make a horizontal bar chart of the word frequencies of non-stop words
